Having easy access to older versions makes us efficient by not having to manually maintain them. Also, any changes that we need to undo can be done easily.

Google docs mostly work with individual files, while Git is a code repository of multiple files.
Undoing changes is a powerful tool that encourages one to take risks.
I want to start using git for my source control.
